# Introduction #

Python is a popular language widely used by the scientific community due to its clear syntax and an extensive number of specialized packages. For image processing or computer vision development, two libraries are prominently used: Numpy & Scipy and a python wrapper of OpenCV. In this paper, we present a comparative evaluation of both libraries, assessing their performance as well as their usability. We also describe how Python implementation of OpenCV performs in comparison to the nativie C++ implementation. Our lessons learnt as a list of recommendations for the scholar community are also presented.
